# How to Use Me

Assuming you are starting an app that you wish to call `rescue-mission` 

In your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/LaunchAcademy/rails-6-boilerplate
cd rails-6-boilerplate 
bundle
yarn install
```

If you prefer, **you can rename your project with the `mv` command.**

Starting from the directory above your app (likely challenges):
mv <source_directory> <target_directory>
